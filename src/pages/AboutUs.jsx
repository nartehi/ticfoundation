                                Growing up in the heart of Ghana, Isaac Narteh, embarked on a journey shaped by a profound lack of access to computer education in the schools he attended. The absence of computers in the classrooms meant that countless children, including himself, missed out on acquiring crucial digital skills that have become indispensable in today's rapidly evolving world.

                                The realization of this digital divide became even more poignant when, after completing high school, he returned to his community to teach children in Grades 4, 5, and 6. Witnessing the same lack of resources in the classrooms mirrored his own childhood experiences. It was a stark reminder that the opportunities he wished for during his school days were still elusive for the younger generation.

                                Determined to make a difference, he pursued a journey across continents, landing in Berea College in the United States to study computer science. Armed with knowledge and a burning passion for change, he founded the TiC Foundation â€” a non-profit organization with a singular mission: to empower young minds with practical computer skills.
